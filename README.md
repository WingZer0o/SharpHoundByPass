# SharpHoundByPass
SharpHound is easily detectable by Windows Defender this simple method allows you to run your scans without Windows Defender interfering. In combination with this repository I also used Confuser to obfusicate the newly created exe. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/mkaring/ConfuserEx). I will leave the usage up to you.
